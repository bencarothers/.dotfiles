# Bash

I don't generally use bash, but it's nice to have a back up when zsh is broken
or isn't availble 

## What's included

Bash configuration is much more minimal. I may decide in the future to flesh
this out a little better, but I'm not very invested in the idea.

## Why

I've broken zsh in the past. Though it's not a regular occurence, I like the
idea of having a lightweight backup.

I do need to reconfigure the colors to something less harsh.
